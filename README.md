# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using various machine learning (ML) models and a deep neural network. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, data splitting, data scaling, model building, and comparison of different models.




## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for diabetes using a dataset containing various health metrics. The project involves:

- Performing EDA to understand the dataset
- Preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Building multiple ML models
- Building a deep neural network model
- Comparing the performance of all models to determine the best predictor.



## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and data transformation.
- Model Building: Implement various ML models including KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes,etc and a deep neural network.
- Model Comparison: Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
